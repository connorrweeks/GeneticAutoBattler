# GeneticAutoBattler
Designed as a way to theoretically analyze team compositions and balancing in MOBAs and Auto-Battlers. Teams of 5 characters are generated and set to fight. Each character has two attributes (i.e. Damage, Range, AOE, Survival, Support, Mobility). Several methods are used to optimize team composition and positioning: Genetic Algorithm and CNN.
